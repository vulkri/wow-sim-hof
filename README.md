WoW Hall of Fame
============

DPS sim made for guild Horde of Hamsters - Burning Legion. Web app is using Simulationcraft Simc as a simulation engine.

I made this app while I was learning FastAPI and HTMX (plus Hyperscript).

I might add more features later (Great Vault helper, Gem optimizer, etc).

App is available at https://sim.hamsterburrow.pl/

You might sim any tank and dps character from the guild [Horde of Hamsters - Burning Legion](https://raider.io/guilds/eu/burning-legion/Horde%20of%20Hamsters/roster#mode=all#mode=all)
